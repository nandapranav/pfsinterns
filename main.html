                <h2>Leadership Story</h2>
                <p>Being the Founder of C-Daith, one of the worst crises' we as a team experienced was related to launching a digital marketing campaign which, after working on it for many months, literally just a week before going into release, we lost our main designer, therefore leaving all plans for our social media campaign messed up. My team's morale had completely hit bottom; the crew simply wanted to turn their backs away.

                    I could never let the project collapse so I took full charge instead. The emergency meeting was conducted; according to the strengths of the team members, I reassigned the tasks, and personally I took the designing role, for which I had lesser experience. Nights were spent learning the basics of graphic design, while taking care of the motivation of our marketing team.
                    
                    Through adaptability and strong leadership, we not only met our deadline but exceeded expectations. The campaign went live on time and garnered more engagement than anticipated, amassing over 5,000 interactions in the first week. What I learned from that experience is that leadership isn't about delegation; it's about stepping up when it really matters.</p>
